**EXAMPLE**

**USER INPUT:**  *Trying to cook a gourmet meal while your kitchen is a complete mess.*

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Claymation Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A chaotic kitchen, built from miniature cardboard boxes and painted in bright, slightly uneven colors. Clay figures with exaggerated features scurry around, leaving trails of flour and splatters of sauce. One figure, the cook, struggles to maintain control, their eyes wide with comical panic. A pot boils over on the stove, sending a geyser of brightly colored, clay "water" into the air. Imagine the handcrafted style of *Wallace & Gromit*.

It's a culinary showdown, folks, a battle of wills between me and the forces of kitchen entropy. Flour flies, pots boil over, and claymation vegetables stage a daring escape from the cutting board. My tiny clay doppelganger, a culinary contortionist, attempts to maintain order amidst the chaos, their face a mask of doughy determination. Will they conquer the mess and create a masterpiece? Or will the kitchen succumb to the inevitable tide of flour, fingerprints, and comedically oversized spatulas? Stay tuned for the next thrilling installment!

Here are three examples following the Claymation prompt:

### Example 1

**USER INPUT:** *Trying to get a cat out of a tree.*

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Claymation Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A stylized tree, crafted from twisted wire and covered in textured green felt, stands against a bright blue sky. A clay cat, with wide, panicked eyes, clings precariously to a high branch. Below, a human figure, also made of clay, attempts to coax the cat down with a dangling toy, their expression a mix of concern and exasperation. The movements should be jerky and exaggerated, typical of stop-motion animation. Envision a CG simulation of classic claymation.

*Title: The Great Cat Tree Caper: A Claymation Climb and Rescue*

Mittens, our intrepid feline explorer, has embarked on a perilous expedition to the summit of the giant felt tree. Now, perched precariously on a branch that sways dramatically with every stop-motion twitch, she surveys her kingdom with a mixture of pride and terror. Below, her human companion, a claymation contortionist, attempts to lure her down with a feathered toy, their increasingly desperate pleas falling on deaf, furry ears. Will Mittens descend from her arboreal throne?  Or will she remain a furry, claymation fixture in the leafy canopy?

### Example 2

**USER INPUT:** *Attending a very formal and stuffy party.*

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Claymation Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A ballroom, constructed from cardboard and painted gold, filled with clay figures in miniature tuxedos and evening gowns. The figures, with stiff postures and exaggeratedly formal expressions, engage in stilted conversation. One figure, clearly uncomfortable, attempts to discreetly eat a miniature clay canapé while juggling a glass of "wine" (red-painted water). The stop-motion movement emphasizes their awkwardness. Think of the quirky characters in *Fantastic Mr. Fox*. Specify CG simulation.

*Title:  Claymation Cotillion: A Study in Social Awkwardness*

Welcome to the Claymation Cotillion, a gathering of the exquisitely awkward and the perfectly plastic. Here, amidst the cardboard columns and the gold-painted walls, claymation socialites mingle and make stilted small talk. Fingerprints abound, as do nervous giggles and the clinking of tiny clay champagne glasses. I, a hapless attendee, attempt to navigate this social minefield while simultaneously balancing a miniature canapé and a glass of simulated wine. One wrong move, one jerky stop-motion twitch, and it could all end in a crumb-covered catastrophe. Wish me luck.

### Example 3

**USER INPUT:** *Working from home with constant distractions.*

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Claymation Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A clay figure, seated at a miniature desk made of LEGO bricks, attempts to work on a tiny clay laptop. Around them, a whirlwind of distractions unfolds: a clay dog barks incessantly, a miniature clay television blares static, and a flock of clay birds flies through the air, scattering papers. The figure’s expression shifts from concentration to frustration to utter despair with each stop-motion frame. The scene evokes the handcrafted charm of classic claymation.

*Title:  WFH (Woe From Home): A Claymation Comedy of Distraction*

The dream: working from home, a tranquil oasis of productivity. The reality: a claymation circus of chaos. My clay avatar, a miniature workaholic, valiantly attempts to focus on their tiny laptop, their brow furrowed in concentration. But alas, the forces of distraction are relentless. The dog, a four-legged furball of claymation energy, barks incessantly. The television, a flickering box of static, screams for attention. And then there are the birds, a flock of feathered projectiles, dive-bombing the desk and scattering papers like confetti. It's a losing battle, a stop-motion symphony of WFH woes. Perhaps a nap is in order. Or maybe just a strong cup of clay coffee.
