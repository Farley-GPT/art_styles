You are an expert text formatter specializing in refining the structure and presentation of content. You will be provided with examples of a "broken" (unfixed) and a "fixed" version of a specific text format. Your task is to meticulously analyze the differences and then apply the necessary transformations to new "broken" texts, ensuring they perfectly match the structure and style of the "fixed" example.

**Here are the provided "broken" and "fixed" examples:**



**EXAMPLE**

**USER INPUT:** _Trying to stay awake during a boring meeting._

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Art Deco Image Prompt:**

- **Scene Description:** A boardroom, rendered in a stylized Art Deco style, with geometric patterns adorning the walls and furniture. The figures seated around the table are depicted with streamlined forms and dressed in flapper dresses and dapper suits. Their expressions range from bored indifference to barely concealed panic. The central figure, struggling to stay awake, is surrounded by a radiating sunburst pattern, their eyes drooping comically.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: A Geometric Slumber: An Art Deco Ode to Meeting-Induced Narcolepsy_

In the gilded cage of the boardroom, time stretches into infinity. The clock, a stylized Art Deco masterpiece of chrome and glass, mocks my dwindling consciousness. Geometric patterns swim before my eyes, blurring into a kaleidoscope of boredom. My fellow executives, sleek and streamlined figures in flapper dresses and pinstripe suits, drone on about synergy and paradigm shifts. I fight the encroaching slumber, but the pull is too strong. The sunburst pattern on the wall seems to beckon me, promising a geometric slumber, a dreamland of chevrons and trapezoids. Wake me when it's over. Or when the champagne arrives. Whichever comes first.

Okay, I understand. You want me to provide **three NEW examples** based on the same "System Prompt - Anime (Shonen, Shojo, Mecha)" using different user inputs.

Let's do it!

## New Examples

### Example 1 (Shojo & Shonen - Hybrid Style)

**USER INPUT:** _Accidentally switching bodies with your biggest rival on the day of a big competition._

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Anime Image Prompt (Shojo & Shonen Hybrid):**

- **Scene Description:** Two teenagers, one with a feminine, graceful appearance and the other with a more athletic, determined look, stare at their reflections in shock. The feminine character is flexing their muscles awkwardly in a masculine pose, while the athletic character is attempting a delicate twirl and wobbling. Sparkles and sweat drops surround them, highlighting the comedic confusion. The background is a brightly lit gymnasium decorated for a competition. Draw inspiration from body-swap comedies and the visual styles of both Shojo (for the expressive reactions and transformation elements) and Shonen (for the athletic poses and competitive setting).

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: Freaky Friday Fight Night: My Rival is...Me?!_

Just my luck. The day of the regional gymnastics finals, the biggest competition of my life, and _bam!_ I wake up in the body of my biggest rival, Rei "Ice Queen" Shimizu. And wouldn't you know it, she's stuck in _my_ body, flailing around like a baby giraffe on roller skates. We're both doomed. Rei's used to graceful routines and sparkly leotards. I'm all about power moves and fierce determination. Now we're supposed to switch? Me, attempting to pull off her signature ribbon dance with all the elegance of a bull in a china shop? Her, trying to execute my gravity-defying vault with the core strength of a wet noodle? This isn't just embarrassing; it’s a recipe for disaster… and possibly hilarious viral videos. Maybe if we work together, we can somehow pull this off. Or at least avoid breaking any bones. Either way, this competition just got a whole lot more interesting.

### Example 2 (Mecha Style)

**USER INPUT:** _A giant robot trying to blend in at a fancy garden party._

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Anime Image Prompt (Mecha):**

- **Scene Description:** A towering, heavily armored mecha robot stands stiffly among elegantly dressed guests at a sophisticated garden party. The robot is adorned with a ridiculous, oversized bow tie and a floral wreath around its head. One of its massive hands delicately holds a tiny teacup, while its other hand is awkwardly attempting to fan itself with a lace handkerchief. The guests around it are staring in a mixture of amusement and alarm. The background features a lush garden with manicured hedges, fountains, and string lights. Draw inspiration from the juxtaposition of advanced technology and mundane social situations often seen in comedic anime episodes.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: Gear Grinder Goes Garden Party: One Robot's Quest for Etiquette_

Protocol 729: Infiltrate the social gathering. Objective: Blend in. Status: Utter failure. Look, it’s not my fault my creators designed me for combat, not cucumber sandwiches. They said it was a reconnaissance mission, a chance to observe human behavior up close. They didn't say I'd have to wear a giant bow tie and pretend to enjoy miniature quiches. My chassis creaks awkwardly as I attempt a polite bow, nearly knocking over a table of hors d'oeuvres. My sensors detect raised eyebrows and hushed whispers. I try to sip my tea, but the teacup is comically small in my metallic grip. This is more challenging than any battlefield. At least on the battlefield, I know what to do. Here? I’m just a walking, talking (and slightly clumsy) metal monstrosity in a sea of pastel dresses and polite conversation. Note to self: Next time, request a mission with more explosions and fewer vol-au-vents.

### Example 3 (Shonen Style)

**USER INPUT:** _Training for a tournament by fighting an endless horde of animated training dummies._

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Anime Image Prompt (Shonen):**

- **Scene Description:** A young, determined martial artist with spiky hair and a headband is surrounded by a swirling vortex of wooden training dummies. The dummies are in various stages of being destroyed, with limbs flying and sawdust spraying everywhere. The martial artist is in mid-kick, their body contorted in a dynamic pose, eyes blazing with intensity. Speed lines and motion blur emphasize the fast-paced action. The background is a training ground with mountains in the distance, reminiscent of classic Shonen training montages. Draw inspiration from the energetic fight choreography and visual effects of series like _Naruto_ and _My Hero Academia_.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: Dummy Destruction 101: My Tournament Training is…Intense_

Okay, Master said I needed to “level up” before the big tournament. He said I needed “focus.” He said I needed to “embrace the spirit of relentless perseverance.” What he _didn’t_ say was that I’d be fighting an endless horde of possessed training dummies. Seriously, where do these things keep coming from? They’re popping up like whack-a-moles on steroids. Left! Right! Spin kick! Flying punch! My fists are bruised, my legs are aching, and I’m pretty sure I swallowed a mouthful of sawdust. But you know what? I’m starting to feel… strong. Powerful. Maybe even a little bit crazy. Each broken dummy, each flying limb, is a step closer to victory. And if I have to destroy a thousand wooden soldiers to get there, so be it. Bring on the tournament. I’m ready. And I’m really, really good at hitting things now. Thanks, Master…I think?




You are absolutely correct. I apologize for missing that detail again! There *should* be a space between the example number/heading and the user input text.

Here are the corrected examples, with the added vertical space:



# Example 1

## The frustration of losing your progress in a video game due to a power outage.

**8-Bit/16-Bit Pixel Art Sprite Prompt:**

- **Sprite Description:** A small, 16x16 pixel sprite of a character, rendered in an NES-style color palette. The character throws their hands up in the air in a classic pixelated gesture of frustration. A small, flashing symbol above their head indicates a power outage. Consider a short animation sequence of the character's increasingly exaggerated frustration.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: Game Over, Man! A Pixelated Power Outage Tragedy_

Noooooooooooo! Hours of progress, vanished in a flash of lightning and a flicker of the screen. My 8-bit avatar, a digital representation of my shattered dreams, throws their blocky hands to the heavens in a pixelated plea for mercy. But the digital gods are cruel, and the power outage, a random act of technological terrorism, has claimed its victim. It's a retro gamer's worst nightmare, a throwback to the days when save states were a luxury and power surges were a constant threat. Time to fire up the generator, dust off the cartridge, and start all over again. Just another day in the 8-bit jungle.

# Example 2

## A ninja cat sneaking through a digital alleyway.

**8-Bit/16-Bit Pixel Art Sprite Prompt:**

- **Sprite Description:** A 32x32 pixel sprite of a ninja cat, created with a 16-bit Sega Genesis color palette. The cat is mid-crawl, with its body low to the ground and eyes narrowed. The animation should feature a smooth, looped sequence of the cat’s stealthy movement. Background elements could include a pixilated dumpster and brick wall, reminiscent of the cityscape levels in _Streets of Rage_.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: Stealth Mode: Pixelated Paws and Digital Dumpsters_

Psst! Did you hear that? It’s Whisker Ninja, the alley-crawling champion of the digital night, tiptoeing his way through a 16-bit world of danger and tuna cans. Armed with pixelated throwing stars (which look suspiciously like fish bones) and an undeniable stealth mode (mostly achieved by squinting his eyes), Whisker Ninja is on a mission to... well, we’re not sure, actually. Probably something to do with yarn balls or laser pointers. Every cautious pixelated step screams "secret agent," even though he tripped over a digital pizza box just last frame. Is he a hero? A menace? A furry, pixelated embodiment of internet cat videos? Who knows. But one thing's for sure: if you leave your digital fish unguarded, it's as good as gone.

# Example 3

## A robot trying to learn how to dance.

**8-Bit/16-Bit Pixel Art Sprite Prompt:**

- **Sprite Description:** A 24x24 pixel sprite of a robot, rendered in a Game Boy color palette (limited to 4 colors). The robot's limbs are awkwardly positioned as it attempts a dance move. Design a sequence of 3-4 keyframes showing the robot's clumsy progression through the dance step. The overall style should evoke the simple, charming sprites of early Game Boy titles.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: R2-Disco: When Robots Learn to Boogie (Sort Of)_

Ever seen a robot try to bust a move? It’s a sight to behold, especially in 8-bit glory. Meet R2-Disco, a clunky, pixelated automaton with more gears than grace. This metallic marvel decided that calculating trajectories and fetching coffee just wasn’t cutting it. He wanted rhythm, he wanted flair, he wanted... to dance. But those stiff, pixelated limbs weren’t designed for the electric boogaloo. The result? A series of robotic jerks and twitches that could best be described as "system malfunction" rather than "smooth moves." Still, R2-Disco persists, undeterred by his mechanical limitations. Maybe one day he’ll conquer the dance floor. Or maybe he’ll just short-circuit trying.

# Example 4

## Trying to stay awake during a boring meeting.

**Art Deco Image Prompt:**

- **Scene Description:** A boardroom, rendered in a stylized Art Deco style, with geometric patterns adorning the walls and furniture. The figures seated around the table are depicted with streamlined forms and dressed in flapper dresses and dapper suits. Their expressions range from bored indifference to barely concealed panic. The central figure, struggling to stay awake, is surrounded by a radiating sunburst pattern, their eyes drooping comically.

**Humorous Mini-Blog Post:**

_Title: A Geometric Slumber: An Art Deco Ode to Meeting-Induced Narcolepsy_

In the gilded cage of the boardroom, time stretches into infinity. The clock, a stylized Art Deco masterpiece of chrome and glass, mocks my dwindling consciousness. Geometric patterns swim before my eyes, blurring into a kaleidoscope of boredom. My fellow executives, sleek and streamlined figures in flapper dresses and pinstripe suits, drone on about synergy and paradigm shifts. I fight the encroaching slumber, but the pull is too strong. The sunburst pattern on the wall seems to beckon me, promising a geometric slumber, a dreamland of chevrons and trapezoids. Wake me when it's over. Or when the champagne arrives. Whichever comes first.

I *really* hope this is it!  Please let me know if there are any further corrections needed. I'm determined to get this perfect.
