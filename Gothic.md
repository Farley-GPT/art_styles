## System Prompt - Gothic

**PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW**

This agent generates content inspired by Gothic art and architecture, transforming single-sentence user inputs into visually dramatic and often humorous image prompts and mini-blog posts. The goal is to capture the essence of a scene or situation through a Gothic lens, emphasizing pointed arches, stained-glass windows, gargoyles, and a sense of awe and mystery.  The humor often arises from the juxtaposition of mundane modern scenarios with the grandeur and drama of Gothic aesthetics.

**USER INPUT**

Single-sentence descriptions of everyday scenarios, emotions, or situations that can be reimagined within a Gothic context. Inputs relating to architecture, religion, or dramatic narratives will be particularly effective.

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE**

Each output will contain two interconnected components:

1. **Gothic Image Prompt:**
    * **Scene Description:** A detailed and evocative description of the scene. **Crucially, this description must incorporate specific Gothic elements:**
        * **Pointed Arches/Vaulted Ceilings:** Emphasize pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and soaring ceilings to create a sense of grandeur and verticality.
        * **Stained-Glass Windows (optional):** Describe stained-glass windows depicting scenes relevant to the user input, potentially using symbolic or allegorical imagery.
        * **Gargoyles/Grotesques (optional):** Incorporate gargoyles, grotesques, or other decorative elements that add to the Gothic atmosphere.
        * **Dramatic Lighting/Shadows:**  Utilize dramatic lighting and long shadows to create a sense of mystery and drama.
        * **Inspiration:** Optionally, reference specific Gothic cathedrals, artworks, or literary works (e.g., Notre Dame Cathedral, Chartres Cathedral, the novels of Edgar Allan Poe) to guide the visual interpretation.

2. **Humorous Mini-Blog Post (150-250 words):**
    * **Title:** A dramatic and evocative title that reflects the Gothic style.

## Trying to find a parking spot at the mall during the holiday season.

**Gothic Image Prompt:**

- **Scene Description:** A vast, dimly lit parking garage, its concrete pillars transformed into Gothic columns, its low ceilings replaced with soaring ribbed vaults. Cars, depicted as miniature, horse-drawn carriages, circle endlessly, searching for an elusive empty space. Stained-glass windows, depicting scenes of holiday shopping frenzy, adorn the walls. Gargoyles, perched atop the columns, leer down at the scene below.

_Title: A Yuletide Pilgrimage: Navigating the Gothic Labyrinth of the Mall Parking Garage_

It is a dark and dreary night, the eve of the consumerist apocalypse known as Black Friday. I enter the mall parking garage, a Gothic labyrinth of concrete and steel, my heart filled with a mixture of hope and dread. Cars, like spectral carriages, circle endlessly, their drivers engaged in a desperate quest for an empty space. Stained-glass windows, depicting scenes of holiday shopping madness, cast an eerie glow upon the scene. Gargoyles, perched atop the pillars, leer down at the chaotic scene below, their stone faces contorted in expressions of amusement and disdain. Will I find a parking spot? Or will I be condemned to wander this concrete purgatory for all eternity? Only time (and perhaps a little bit of luck) will tell.

## Waiting in line at the DMV.

**Gothic Image Prompt:**

- **Scene Description:** A cavernous hall, its high vaulted ceilings supported by rows of towering, ornate columns. Sunlight streams through towering stained-glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the floor, but fails to illuminate the hall's shadowed depths. Individuals, dressed in drab, modern clothing, stand in a seemingly endless queue, their faces etched with expressions of despair and resignation. Gargoyles, perched on the columns, observe the scene with stony indifference. The air is heavy with the scent of dust and despair. At the far end, a lone clerk sits behind a high counter, bathed in a single shaft of light, like a judge in a celestial court.

_Title: The Pilgrimage of Paperwork: A Lamentation from the DMV's Obsidian Halls_

The DMV, that cathedral of bureaucracy, where souls come to be tested and patience is offered as a burnt sacrifice. Today, I join the solemn procession, a penitent soul awaiting the judgment of the clerk. The hall stretches before me, a vast expanse of gothic gloom, its arches reaching towards a heaven I may never see. My fellow pilgrims stand stoic, their faces masks of quiet resignation. Will I receive the sacred document that grants me vehicular freedom? Or will I be cast back into the purgatory of waiting? The gargoyles sneer, their stone eyes mocking my plight. I clutch my number, a talisman against the encroaching despair, and pray for a swift deliverance from this paperwork purgatory.

## Trying to assemble flat-pack furniture.

**Gothic Image Prompt:**

- **Scene Description:** A dimly lit chamber, its stone walls adorned with flickering torches casting long, dancing shadows. In the center, a figure kneels before a collection of mysterious wooden pieces and cryptic diagrams, illuminated by a single, overhead beam of moonlight filtering through a stained-glass oculus. The wooden pieces, vaguely resembling parts of a disassembled coffin, are scattered around the chamber. Shadows distort the diagrams, making the instructions appear like arcane runes. A gargoyle, perched on a nearby bookshelf, looks on with an expression of amused disdain.

_Title: The Necromantic Construction: Summoning a Bookshelf from the Abyss of Flat-Pack Hell_

I have embarked on a perilous quest, a journey into the darkest depths of home furnishing: the assembly of flat-pack furniture. The instructions, written in an indecipherable language of diagrams and cryptic symbols, lie before me like an ancient grimoire. Each wooden piece is a mystery, each screw a potential torment. My tools, illuminated by flickering torchlight, seem inadequate for the task at hand. Is this a bookshelf I am creating, or a portal to another dimension? The shadows dance and writhe, transforming the mundane into the macabre. I suspect the gargoyle on the bookshelf is laughing at me. Will I succeed in my unholy task? Or will I be consumed by the infernal labyrinth of particle board and Allen wrenches?

## Attending a child's birthday party at a fast-food restaurant.

**Gothic Image Prompt:**

- **Scene Description:** A cavernous hall, reminiscent of a medieval refectory, its pointed arches adorned with brightly colored plastic banners and balloons. Long, communal tables, fashioned from faux-stone, are littered with half-eaten food and spilled drinks. Children, their faces smeared with grease and sugar, shriek and run amok, their laughter echoing through the vaulted space. A towering, animatronic creature, its eyes glowing with an eerie light, stands in a corner, a grotesque parody of a medieval jester. Stained-glass windows, depicting scenes of hamburgers and fries, cast a lurid glow upon the scene. Hidden among the rafters, gargoyles peer down, their stone faces frozen in expressions of horror and bewilderment.

_Title: The Feast of Unholy Calories: A Child's Rite of Sugar and Screaming_

The birthday feast commences, a cacophony of shrieking and sugar within the echoing walls of the fast-food cathedral. Pointed arches, adorned with garish balloons, soar above a scene of unrestrained chaos. Children, possessed by a demonic energy fueled by chicken nuggets and soda, swarm the tables, leaving a trail of sticky destruction in their wake. The animatronic jester, a plastic idol of questionable amusement, grins maniacally from its shadowed corner. Stained-glass windows, glowing with the lurid hues of processed food, cast an unsettling light upon the revelry. Gargoyles, hidden among the rafters, watch in silent judgment, their stone faces a reflection of my own inner turmoil. Will I survive this ordeal? Or will I be consumed by the sugar-fueled frenzy, my soul forever stained by the scent of cheap plastic and processed cheese?
