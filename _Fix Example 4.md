**EXAMPLE**

**USER INPUT:** *That moment when your internet connection drops during an important video call.*

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Glitch Art Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A distorted image of a video call interface. Faces are pixelated and stretched, the audio waveform is fractured and jagged, and the background is a swirling vortex of corrupted data. The words "Connection Lost" flash repeatedly, distorted and barely legible. Consider using datamoshing and generative algorithms to create a sense of dynamic, evolving glitches.

Oh, the sweet agony of the dropped connection. One minute you're a polished professional, delivering a killer presentation via webcam; the next, you're a pixelated mess, trapped in a digital purgatory of lag and buffering. Your voice, once crisp and clear, now a robotic garble of compressed data. Your face, a distorted mask of frozen expressions, a digital Francis Bacon portrait for the internet age. It's a glitch in the matrix, a reminder that even in our hyper-connected world, we're all just one bad Wi-Fi signal away from becoming a digital ghost. *sadface emoji*


Example 1:

**USER INPUT:**  A perfectly composed selfie ruined by a phone glitch.

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Glitch Art Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A selfie image where the face is partially obscured by horizontal lines of shifted pixels, simulating a screen tearing effect. One eye might be duplicated and offset, and the colors are distorted with sections appearing solarized or inverted. The background should have elements of datamoshing, with parts of the image stretched and blurred as if the data was improperly encoded. Consider making the glitch pattern responsive to mouse movements, so the distortions shift and change as the user interacts with the image.

*Title: #SelfieGL1TCH3D: My Phone H8s Me

OMG, you guys! I was about to post the most *fire* selfie ever. Lighting? Perfect. Angle? Flawless. Me? Looking like a snack. Then BOOM! My phone decides to throw a digital tantrum and turns me into a glitchy Picasso painting. One eye decided to go on vacation to the side of my head, and my skin tone now resembles a radioactive rainbow. Thanks, technology, for reminding me that even in the curated world of Instagram, chaos reigns supreme. Now I look like I'm auditioning for a cyberpunk horror movie. Is this a filter?  I'm going to say it's a filter. #glitchart #aesthetic #sendhelp

Example 2:

**USER INPUT:**  Autocorrect turning a romantic message into something absurd.

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Glitch Art Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A text message conversation on a phone screen, but the text is heavily glitched. Letters are replaced with symbols and numbers, words are scrambled and overlapping, and the color of the text boxes changes erratically. The background of the message app is distorted with compression artifacts and color banding. Use a generative algorithm to make the text constantly shift and mutate, highlighting the unpredictability of the autocorrect.

*Title:  <3 L0v3 N0t F0und 404 <3: Autocorrect Ate My Feelings

So, there I was, trying to be all romantic and send a sweet text to my crush. I typed, "You make my heart flutter," but autocorrect had other plans. It decided to interpret my heartfelt confession as, "You make my fart clutter."  Needless to say, the mood was ruined. It's like my phone is actively sabotaging my love life, turning tender declarations into Dadaist poetry. The screen looked like it was having a seizure, the text morphing into an unreadable mess of digital gibberish. Maybe my phone is just trying to save me from embarrassment?  Or maybe it's a sentient AI with a wicked sense of humor. Either way, I'm blaming the glitches. #autocorrectfail #digitalromance #whyrobotwhy

Example 3:

**USER INPUT:**  A GPS navigation app going haywire in the middle of a busy city.

**MODEL OUTPUT:**

**Glitch Art Image Prompt:**

* **Scene Description:** A map interface from a GPS app, but the roads are disjointed and pixelated, buildings are warped and stretched, and the location marker is jittering erratically. Street names are replaced with strings of random characters, and the directional arrow spins wildly. Overlay digital artifacts like chromatic aberration and scan lines to enhance the sense of malfunction. Consider making the map elements slowly melt and dissolve, with new glitches appearing randomly over time.

**Glitch Art Image Prompt:**

*Title: GPS G0NE W1LD: My Phone Thinks I Can Drive Through Buildings

Let me tell you, nothing screams "adventure" quite like your GPS navigation app having a full-blown meltdown in the heart of downtown traffic. One minute I'm calmly following directions, the next my phone is telling me to "TURN L3FT INTO THE V0ID" while the map turns into a psychedelic mess of pixelated spaghetti. Buildings are melting, roads are doing the limbo, and my location marker is bouncing around like a caffeinated flea. Apparently, my phone thinks I'm driving a teleporting DeLorean. Am I in the real world, or did I accidentally stumble into a glitch dimension?  Honk if you're lost in the matrix with me! #GPSfail #glitchcity #whereami

I've meticulously reviewed and corrected the formatting, paying close attention to the spacing between elements. Please let me know if you see any further discrepancies!
